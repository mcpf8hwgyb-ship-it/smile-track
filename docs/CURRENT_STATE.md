# SMILE TRACK — CURRENT STATE

## Project Status

Status: F01 IMPLEMENTED — VALIDATION IN PROGRESS; ARCHITECT REVIEW PENDING

F01 establishes a minimal static application shell. No product features are implemented.

The Architect-approved stack is recorded in D-003 in `DECISIONS.md`.

No application features have been implemented yet.

---

## Current Repository State

VERIFIED:

- Private GitHub repository created.
- Master project specification added.
- Architect and Builder workflows established in the ChatGPT Smile Track Project.

---

## Implemented

- Static Next.js App Router shell, React, strict TypeScript, CSS Modules.
- Preview status and non-diagnostic positioning; semantic landmarks and skip navigation.
- Node/npm pins, lockfile, ESLint, Playwright desktop/mobile smoke tests.
- Read-only GitHub Actions validation workflow.
- No accounts, media capture, analytics, health-data inputs, or persistence.

---

## In Progress

- F01 validation and Architect review on `f01-app-foundation`.

---

## Known Bugs

None yet.

---

## Technical Debt

Minimal ESLint baseline does not include Next/React-specific plugin rules. Browser coverage is Chromium only; real-device and assistive-technology review remain future work.

---

## Scientific / Dental Unknowns

See `MASTER_PROJECT.md`.

Important unresolved areas include:

- physical scale calibration;
- selected tooth identity/laterality questions;
- CEJ interpretation;
- complete arch construction;
- contacts;
- occlusion;
- anatomical certification.

These uncertainties must not be silently resolved during normal product development.

---

## Current Blockers

None for normal product development.

Scientific dental-model work has unresolved questions documented in the master project specification.

---

## Last Validation

See `VALIDATION_LOG.md` for exact commands, results, environment blockers, and CI evidence.

---

## Next Decision

The Architect must review F01 evidence before merge or authorizing another task.
